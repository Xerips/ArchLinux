_Things to consider before running Arch for Pentesting/Forensics/Cyber Security/etc:_  
(Warning, completely skippable section below.)

- Do you really want to live in / daily drive Arch? It's okay nerd friends, I do too.
- Are you not particularly concerned with having a _more_ unique fingerprint?
  - If you're going for maximum anonymity, having a very unique setup can compromise that anonymity. When you reach out to things on the internet through your browser or other services, you will be fingerprinted by the destinations you touch. For maximum anonymity when it comes to fingerprinting, use the most popular tools with minimal configuration changes. Doing this makes your system seem like all the others and you're more likely to be able to hide in the crowd. Having a super riced optimally configured browser, os, etc. can help distinguish you from other users, and not in a good way.
  - If you're looking for anonymity, consider using the Tor browser with minimal configuration changes (look up guides if needed!). It is much slower as traffic is routed through the onion network but it's much more secure than the top browsers out there.
- You may also be interested in installing BlackArch as a VM to have a large tool selection out of the box and customize it as you need for your pentesting/forensic/etc machine. Using a pre-built pen testing OS on virtual boxes like those found on [vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) or [hack the box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) is a great way to find and learn new tools and techniques.
  - Black Arch is not very pretty out of the box and it's base functionality isn't something I'd be happy with. That being said, if you want a machine that's based on arch that is ready to go out of the box Black Arch might might work well for you. You can slowly (or obsessively, dealers choice) make it your own, without having to build from scratch.
- I don't want to use Kali Linux anymore but honestly, everyone who is new to cyber security needs to experience opening Kali for the first time, changing your wallpaper to some wild hacker background (they have an awesome graffiti kali wallpaper it ships with;)), sudo apt update'ing, then poking through the tools vowing to learn every single one and then becoming an internet wizard king. It's pretty much the first hacker rite of passage, and everyone should experience it. So if you've never used kali, do it up.
