### [Dirty Twin](https://github.com/Xerips/ArchLinux/tree/main/DirtyTwin)

This is our "Dirty Twin." It is a copy of our system as a virtual machine that we use to install penetration testing tools from the Black Arch pacman repository.  
We can use this VM for penetration tests, testing our host system's security and monitoring tools, playing with unstable tech, etc.
